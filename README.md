# FSharp_Fractals
This is a small experiment to test out the Websharper ID using F# to draw what is known as the Pythagorean Tree fractal, with random angles.

A demo endpoint of this code can be found at: https://try.websharper.com/snippet/user3757/0000RM

This was a fun little challenge that forced me to brush up on some old math, and this is also one of those problems where you are forced to use recursion, which F# is particularly good at.
One thing that I wanted to try out was F# for something that is more mathematical, however, when I actually wrote the code I did not feel like F# gave me much of an advantage when writing this code.
This might be because my approach is wrong, or because of the way that canvas works.

Let me know if I missed something simple that would have made this much easier.

Also let me know if you have any questions on the code as is.
